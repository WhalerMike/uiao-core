# Authorization Boundary

**Classification:** Public  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Generated:** Auto-generated  

---



## 1. Boundary Overview

### 1.1 System Identification

- **System Name:** UIAO
- **Acronym:** UIAO
- **Authorization Level:** FedRAMP Moderate (NIST 800-53 Rev 5)
- **Boundary Owner:** UIAO Program Office
- **Classification:** Public

### 1.2 Boundary Definition

The UIAO authorization boundary is defined as all hardware,
software, infrastructure, data, people, procedures, and facilities that
are necessary to operate the system and are under the direct management
and security control of the system owner.

Components **inside** the boundary:
- All control plane services managed by the agency
- Identity provider and ICAM infrastructure
- Network fabric (SD-WAN nodes managed by the agency)
- IPAM / DNS platform instances
- SIEM and telemetry aggregation infrastructure
- Management plane policy engines and orchestration systems

Components **outside** the boundary (leveraged services):
- FedRAMP-authorized cloud service providers (CSPs)
- Third-party SaaS tools with separate ATO packages
- Agency physical infrastructure shared with other systems

### 2.2 Network Segmentation

The UIAO network is segmented into the following zones:

| Zone | Description | Controls Applied |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| External / Untrusted | Internet-facing; no direct system access | CDN, WAF, NGFW filtering |
| DMZ / Perimeter | Gateway and proxy services | TLS termination, API gateway, WAF rules |
| Identity Zone | IdP and PAM services | Zero Trust Policy Engine, Entra ID CA |
| Network Fabric | SD-WAN overlay | mTLS encryption, micro-segmentation |
| Data Zone | Backend services and data stores | Encryption at rest, RBAC, audit logging |
| Telemetry Zone | SIEM and monitoring | Immutable log storage, restricted write access |
| Management Zone | Orchestration and policy | Break-glass procedures, session recording |

## 3. External Connections

### 3.1 External Connection Inventory

All external connections to the UIAO system boundary are documented below.
Connections are reviewed quarterly and updated in this canonical document.

| Connection | Direction | Protocol | Encryption | Purpose | Risk Level |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Agency Staff → UIAO Gateway | Inbound | HTTPS (443) | TLS 1.3 | User access | Medium |
| UIAO → Entra ID (Microsoft 365) | Outbound | HTTPS (443) | TLS 1.3 | Identity federation | Low |
| UIAO → InfoBlox Cloud | Outbound | HTTPS/DNS | TLS 1.3 / DNSSEC | IPAM / DNS | Low |
| Cisco SD-WAN → vManage | Bidirectional | HTTPS / NETCONF | TLS 1.3 | SD-WAN control plane | Low |
| UIAO → Microsoft Sentinel | Outbound | HTTPS (443) | TLS 1.3 | Log ingestion | Low |
| UIAO → CDM/CLAW | Outbound | HTTPS (443) | TLS 1.3 | Asset telemetry | Low |
| UIAO → CSP (Azure GovCloud) | Bidirectional | HTTPS / ExpressRoute | TLS 1.3 / IPSec | Cloud workloads | Medium |

### 3.2 Inherited Controls from Cloud Service Providers


- **Microsoft (Entra ID + Sentinel):** FedRAMP High Authorized (Azure Government)
- **Cisco (SD-WAN):** FedRAMP Moderate Authorized
- **InfoBlox (BloxOne):** FedRAMP Moderate Authorized
- **CyberArk (PAM):** FedRAMP Moderate Authorized
