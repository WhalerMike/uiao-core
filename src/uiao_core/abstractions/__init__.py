"""Vendor-neutral abstraction layer for UIAO-Core.

Agencies running different identity, network, or DNS stacks can provide
concrete implementations of the abstract base classes defined here without
modifying any of the core generators.

Typical usage::

    from uiao_core.abstractions import IdentityProvider, NetworkEdge, DNSProvider

Concrete vendor implementations live in ``data/vendor-overlays/``.  The
overlay YAML files are deep-merged into the context at load time by
:func:`uiao_core.utils.context.load_context`.
