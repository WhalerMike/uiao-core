# RELEASE NOTES: MODERNIZATION ATLAS V1.0

**Date:** March 20, 2026

**Status:** Production-Ready (Sandbox/Pilot)

**Classification:** CUI // FED-ONLY

---

## Executive Summary

The Modernization Atlas v1.0 is a unified orchestration layer designed to accelerate the agency's transition to a Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) as mandated by **EO 14028** and **OMB M-22-09**. It replaces manual, ticket-based Joiner/Mover/Leaver (JML) processes with a headless orchestrator that synchronizes Identity, Network, and Management planes in near real-time.

## Key Features & Stacks

| Component | Stack | Capability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity & Trust** | Stack 1 | HRIS-driven lifecycle automation with ABAC-based group transitions (Mover/Leaver logic) |
| **Management & Governance** | Stack 2 | Real-time sync between InfoBlox, CyberArk, and ServiceNow via Pull-Transform-Push orchestrators |
| **Visibility & Telemetry** | Stack 3 | KQL-driven alerting via Microsoft Sentinel triggering automated enforcement actions |
| **Enforcement Engine** | Layer 4 | <120-second network isolation via Palo Alto Panorama DAG and Cisco SD-WAN (vManage) |

---

## What's New in v1.0

- **Automated Artifact Generation:** CI/CD pipeline generates the 11-slide Pitch Deck (PPTX) and Project Plan (MS Planner CSV) on every push to main
- **Visual Manifest:** Complete library of 12 architectural assets (6 Mermaid diagrams, 6 AI-generated PNGs)
- **Operational SOPs:** Formalized handbook for SecOps covering health monitoring, manual overrides, escalation paths, and kill-switch procedures
- **Compliance Readiness:** Mapping of Atlas capabilities to NIST 800-53 controls for streamlined ATO in GCC-Moderate
- **Identity Lifecycle Canon:** Mover and Leaver scenarios with detailed narratives and metrics integrated into leadership briefing YAML
- **CyberArk Integration:** Privileged access synchronization completing the Management & Governance Plane
- **Network Enforcement:** SD-WAN quarantine and Palo Alto Dynamic Address Group automation
- **E2E Testing:** Integration test simulating Leaver event through full enforcement pipeline

## Technical Verification

- **CI Build:** All workflows (`generate_docs`, `changelog`, `generate_artifacts`) passing on main
- **Testing:** E2E logic verified via `tests/test_e2e_atlas_flow.py` simulating Leaver quarantine event
- **Governance:** Environment variables standardized in `.env.example` for secure agency deployment
- **Documentation:** MkDocs navigation updated with Implementation, Compliance, and Executive sections

## Compliance Alignment

| Control | Standard | Atlas Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| AC-2 | NIST 800-53 | JML logic automated via HRIS sync |
| AC-3 | NIST 800-53 | Automated Palo Alto/SD-WAN quarantine |
| AU-2 | NIST 800-53 | Sentinel KQL alerts and ServiceNow sync logs |
| IA-2 | NIST 800-53 | PIV/FIDO2 MFA requirement in JML logic |
| SI-4 | NIST 800-53 | Continuous monitoring via Sentinel telemetry |

Aligns with **EO 14028**, **OMB M-22-09**, **FedRAMP GCC-Moderate**, **TIC 3.0**, and **NIST 800-63**.

## Next Steps (v1.1 Roadmap)

1. Migrate from GitHub-hosted sandbox to Agency GCC-Moderate environment for Pilot Phase
2. Configure self-hosted GitHub Actions runners within agency VPC
3. Upgrade authentication from service accounts to OAuth2/mTLS
4. Deploy Sentinel-to-Logic App webhook bridge for real-time enforcement
5. Conduct SecOps training drill using Leaver scenario runbook

*The Modernization Atlas v1.0 represents a structural modernization of how the agency authenticates, addresses, routes, observes, and governs every digital interaction.*
